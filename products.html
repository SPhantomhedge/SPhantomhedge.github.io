  <h1>Our Product Suite</h1>

  <h2>Phantom RiskOS</h2>
  <p>A forward-looking risk intelligence platform designed to anticipate regime shifts, volatility clusters, and structural breaks. Built for real-time diagnostics, dynamic exposure management, and behavioral sensitivity — tailored to how modern portfolios behave.</p>

  <h2>Phantom Trade Intelligence</h2>
  <p>An execution assistant platform that combines predictive modeling, volatility structure, and risk bands to guide position entry, size optimization, and dynamic hedging. Designed to reduce execution friction while amplifying strategic intent.</p>

  <h2>Agentic AI Systems</h2>
  <p>We are integrating autonomous agentic workflows that scan, interpret, and respond to high-volume data streams across news, sentiment, and price movements. These systems form the foundation of forward signal discovery inside Phantom RiskOS and Trade Intelligence.</p>

  <h2>Phantom AI Marketplace</h2>
  <p>A secure plug-and-play ecosystem (coming 2026) where developers and quant researchers can offer AI models to institutional fund managers — with Phantom providing integration, validation, and compliance support. We enable model discovery without signal leakage or IP exposure.</p>
