  <h1>About Phantom Hedge</h1>
  <p><strong>Phantom Hedge</strong> began as a response to a simple but stubborn problem: traditional risk management tools were not built for the pace and complexity of modern markets. As engineers and strategists managing proprietary capital, we needed tools that could adapt, anticipate, and protect — not just explain what went wrong after the fact.</p>

  <h2>Our Origins</h2>
  <p>Phantom Hedge UG was founded by a team with deep experience in embedded systems, simulations, and portfolio strategy. With backgrounds spanning financial modeling, engineering systems, and AI architecture, we brought a first-principles mindset to a field that had become reliant on legacy tools.</p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>To develop resilient, adaptive investment infrastructure that reflects the realities of today’s market regimes — and make them available to fund managers who need more than historical data and static models.</p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>We envision a future where asset managers, regardless of size, have access to AI-native tools that not only forecast risk but also guide execution, adapt to structural shifts, and scale with strategy complexity.</p>

  <p>Our belief is simple: <strong>risk isn’t just a constraint — it’s an input</strong>. And systems built with this philosophy deserve to be shared with those who manage capital seriously.</p>
